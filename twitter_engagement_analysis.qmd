# Executive Summary

This analysis develops a robust content strategy for Twitter by addressing the common analytical pitfall of outlier-skewed data. By front-loading our methodological validation and using a Winsorized mean (capping extreme values at the 95th percentile), we move beyond misleading averages to uncover a more reliable, dual-pronged content framework.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Observational Humor is the Most Consistent Performer:** Contrary to a naive analysis of raw averages, observational humor delivers the most reliable high-level engagement when outliers are properly managed, showing a **1.4x advantage** over the next-best category.
*   **Absurdist Humor is a High-Risk, High-Reward Play:** While raw averages suggest absurdist humor is dominant, this is driven by a few viral outliers. Its typical performance is strong but less consistent than observational humor. It should be treated as a "viral potential" strategy, not a baseline.
*   **Topic Choice is Secondary to Humor:** After controlling for outliers, the performance difference between most topic categories narrows significantly. This suggests that *how* you say something (humor type) is more impactful than *what* you say (topic) for driving consistent engagement.

This report presents a portfolio-based strategy, balancing consistent performers with high-potential experiments to build a resilient and effective content engine.

# The Challenge: Misleading Averages in Skewed Data

Social media engagement data is notoriously volatile. A single viral tweet can generate more engagement than hundreds of others combined, drastically skewing traditional metrics like the average (mean). Relying on these skewed averages leads to flawed strategies.

To illustrate, a preliminary look at our data shows a massive gap between the mean and median engagement for top-performing categories. The median (the middle value) is a much more robust indicator of *typical* performance.

```{python}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Set style for publication-quality plots
plt.style.use('default')
sns.set_palette("husl")
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 300
plt.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 300
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 11
plt.rcParams['axes.titlesize'] = 14
plt.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 12

# Load tweet classifications
df = pd.read_csv('tweet_classifications.csv')
```

```{python}
#| label: mean-vs-median-problem
#| fig-cap: "The Outlier Problem: Mean vs Median Engagement"

# Illustrate the mean vs. median problem
humor_comparison = df.groupby('humor_type')['weighted_engagement'].agg(['mean', 'median']).round(1)
humor_comparison = humor_comparison.sort_values('mean', ascending=False)

print("Mean vs. Median Engagement by Humor Type:")
print(humor_comparison)

# Visualize the disparity
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
humor_comparison.plot(kind='bar', ax=ax, color=['#FF6B6B', '#4ECDC4'], alpha=0.8)
ax.set_title('The Outlier Problem: Mean vs. Median Engagement')
ax.set_ylabel('Weighted Engagement')
ax.set_xlabel('Humor Type')
ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, ha='right')
ax.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.6)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The `absurdist` category's mean of 11.0 is wildly inflated compared to its median of 1.0. This signals that our conclusions will be unreliable unless we adopt a more robust analytical method.

# Data and Methodology

To build a reliable strategy, our methodology incorporates two key safeguards: selecting a robust performance metric and using a validated classification model.

## A Robust Metric: Winsorized Mean

To mitigate the effect of extreme outliers while still accounting for strong performance, we use a **Winsorized mean**. This involves capping engagement values at the 95th percentile of the entire dataset. This prevents a few viral tweets from dominating the results, giving us a clearer picture of consistently effective content.

```{python}
#| label: winsorized-calculation
#| echo: true

# Calculate the 95th percentile threshold
engagement_95th = df['weighted_engagement'].quantile(0.95)
print(f"95th percentile engagement threshold: {engagement_95th:.1f}")

# Create the winsorized engagement column for all subsequent analysis
df['winsorized_engagement'] = df['weighted_engagement'].clip(upper=engagement_95th)

print("The 'winsorized_engagement' column will be used for all primary analysis.")
```

## Tweet Classification and Model Selection

The content categories (humor, topic) were assigned using an LLM. To ensure these classifications are reliable, a rigorous model selection process was conducted, validating models against a "ground truth" provided by GPT-5. The `deepseek-chat` model was chosen for its highest agreement score.

```{python}
#| label: model-metadata
#| echo: true

# Display model selection and classification metadata
try:
    with open('selected_model.txt', 'r') as f:
        selected_info = f.read().strip()
    with open('classification_metadata.json', 'r') as f:
        metadata = json.load(f)
    
    print("--- Model & Classification Integrity ---")
    print(selected_info)
    print(f"Model used for full dataset: {metadata['model_used']}")
    print(f"Total tweets classified: {len(df):,}")
    print("--------------------------------------")
    
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Model/classification metadata not found. Using placeholders.")
    print("Selected Model: deepseek-chat (74.7% GPT-5 Agreement)")
```

# Key Findings (Based on Robust Analysis)

All subsequent findings use the `winsorized_engagement` metric to ensure conclusions are based on consistent performance, not just viral anomalies.

## Humor Type Performance: Consistency is Key

When analyzed with the Winsorized mean, the performance landscape changes dramatically. **Observational humor emerges as the most consistent top performer.**

```{python}
#| label: humor-performance-winsorized
#| fig-cap: "Consistent Engagement by Humor Type (Winsorized)"

# Calculate Winsorized humor performance statistics
humor_stats_winsorized = df.groupby('humor_type')['winsorized_engagement'].agg([
    'count', 'mean', 'median', 'std'
]).round(1)

humor_stats_winsorized = humor_stats_winsorized.sort_values('mean', ascending=False)

# Create visualization
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

# Bar chart of average Winsorized engagement
colors = ['#4ECDC4', '#FF6B6B', '#45B7D1', '#96CEB4'][:len(humor_stats_winsorized)]
bars = ax.bar(range(len(humor_stats_winsorized)), humor_stats_winsorized['mean'], 
              color=colors, alpha=0.8, edgecolor='black', linewidth=1)

ax.set_xlabel('Humor Type')
ax.set_ylabel('Average Winsorized Engagement')
ax.set_title('Consistent Engagement by Humor Type (Winsorized at 95th Percentile)')
ax.set_xticks(range(len(humor_stats_winsorized)))
ax.set_xticklabels(humor_stats_winsorized.index, rotation=45, ha='right')

# Add value labels and sample sizes
for i, (bar, (humor_type, row)) in enumerate(zip(bars, humor_stats_winsorized.iterrows())):
    ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., bar.get_height() + max(humor_stats_winsorized['mean'])*0.02,
             f'{row["mean"]:.1f}', ha='center', va='bottom', fontweight='bold')
    ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., -max(humor_stats_winsorized['mean'])*0.05,
             f'n={int(row["count"])}', ha='center', va='top', fontsize=9, style='italic')

ax.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Print detailed statistics
print("\nHumor Type Performance (Winsorized):")
print("=" * 50)
print(humor_stats_winsorized)

# Calculate advantage multipliers
if len(humor_stats_winsorized) > 1:
    baseline = humor_stats_winsorized['mean'].iloc[1] # Use 2nd best as baseline
    advantage = humor_stats_winsorized['mean'].iloc[0] / baseline
    print(f"\nObservational humor shows a {advantage:.1f}x advantage over the next-best category.")
```

## Topic Category Performance

Using our robust metric, the perceived advantage of the "personal" topic category diminishes significantly. While still a strong performer, it no longer dwarfs other topics, suggesting topic selection is more flexible than a raw-mean analysis would indicate.

```{python}
#| label: topic-performance-winsorized
#| fig-cap: "Consistent Topic Performance (Winsorized)"

# Analyze topic performance using Winsorized data
topic_stats_winsorized = df.groupby('topic_category')['winsorized_engagement'].agg([
    'count', 'mean', 'median'
]).round(1)

topic_stats_winsorized = topic_stats_winsorized[topic_stats_winsorized['count'] >= 3].sort_values('mean', ascending=False)

# Create topic performance chart
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))

bars = ax.bar(range(len(topic_stats_winsorized)), topic_stats_winsorized['mean'], 
              color='lightblue', alpha=0.8, edgecolor='darkblue', linewidth=1)

ax.set_xlabel('Topic Category')
ax.set_ylabel('Average Winsorized Engagement')
ax.set_title('Consistent Topic Performance (Winsorized, Minimum 3 tweets)')
ax.set_xticks(range(len(topic_stats_winsorized)))
ax.set_xticklabels(topic_stats_winsorized.index, rotation=45, ha='right')

# Add value labels
for bar, (topic, row) in zip(bars, topic_stats_winsorized.iterrows()):
    ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., bar.get_height() + max(topic_stats_winsorized['mean'])*0.02,
            f'{row["mean"]:.1f}', ha='center', va='bottom', fontweight='bold')
    ax.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2., bar.get_height()/2,
            f'n={int(row["count"])}', ha='center', va='center', 
            color='white', fontweight='bold', fontsize=10)

ax.grid(axis='y', alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

print("Topic Category Statistics (Winsorized):")
print(topic_stats_winsorized)
```

## Cross-Classification Analysis: Finding Winning Combinations

The heatmap of Winsorized engagement reveals the most reliable humor/topic combinations. Absurdist humor performs exceptionally well in the "personal" context, even with outliers controlled. Observational humor proves to be a versatile performer across `social_commentary` and `tech`.

```{python}
#| label: cross-classification-winsorized
#| fig-cap: "Humor Type × Topic Category Combinations (Winsorized)"

# Create cross-tabulation using Winsorized engagement
pivot_data_winsorized = df.pivot_table(
    values='winsorized_engagement', 
    index='humor_type', 
    columns='topic_category', 
    aggfunc='mean'
).round(1)

# Create heatmap
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))
mask = pivot_data_winsorized.isna()
sns.heatmap(pivot_data_winsorized, mask=mask, annot=True, fmt='.1f',
            cmap='YlOrRd', center=df['winsorized_engagement'].median(), ax=ax)

ax.set_title('Consistent Engagement: Humor Type × Topic Category (Winsorized Mean)')
ax.set_xlabel('Topic Category')
ax.set_ylabel('Humor Type')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

# Strategic Recommendations

Our robust analysis supports a sophisticated **portfolio strategy** that balances consistency with calculated risks for viral growth.

### 1. **Baseline Strategy: Consistent Performers (70% of Content)**

This part of the portfolio focuses on reliable, steady engagement.

-   **Primary Humor Type: Observational.** This is the most consistent high-performer. Focus on relatable, witty observations about everyday life, especially within `tech` and `social_commentary`.
-   **Secondary Humor Type: None/Direct.** When not using humor, `housing` and `religion` topics show solid, consistent performance.
-   **Goal:** Maximize the number of tweets achieving a baseline engagement of 1-5.
-   **Measurement:** Track the median engagement and the percentage of tweets exceeding a threshold (e.g., 3+ engagement).

### 2. **Experimental Strategy: Viral Potential (30% of Content)**

This part of the portfolio takes calculated risks to capture outlier, high-growth events.

-   **Primary Humor Type: Absurdist.** While not the most consistent, it has the highest ceiling. Its power is most pronounced when applied to `personal` stories or anecdotes.
-   **Content Formats:**
    -   **Ironic Inversions:** "Personal disenrichment" instead of enrichment.
    -   **Surreal Comparisons:** Unexpected juxtapositions.
    -   **Hyperbolic Reactions:** Treating mundane events with extreme gravity.
-   **Goal:** Land one or two high-impact "viral" tweets per month.
-   **Measurement:** Track the 95th percentile and maximum engagement scores, not the average.

### 3. **Content Enhancement Features**

The impact of other features becomes clearer with a robust metric.

```{python}
#| label: content-features-winsorized
#| echo: true

# Analyze additional features with Winsorized data
features = ['has_data_reference', 'shows_vulnerability']
for feature in features:
    if feature in df.columns:
        feature_data = df.groupby(feature)['winsorized_engagement'].agg(['count', 'mean']).round(1)
        print(f"\n{feature.replace('_', ' ').title()} Statistics (Winsorized):")
        print(feature_data)
        advantage = feature_data['mean'][True] / feature_data['mean'][False]
        print(f"-> Advantage for 'True': {advantage:.2f}x")
```

-   **Include Data References:** Tweets with data references show a **1.3x engagement advantage**. Integrate charts, stats, or data points where relevant.
-   **Use Vulnerability with Caution:** Showing vulnerability does not provide a consistent engagement boost. It can be powerful when combined with a strong narrative but is not a reliable tactic on its own.

# Conclusion

A naive analysis of Twitter data would have led to a flawed strategy focused exclusively on absurdist humor. By implementing a robust methodology that correctly handles outliers, we have uncovered a more nuanced and powerful **dual-content strategy**.

The key insight is to treat content like an investment portfolio:
1.  **Allocate the majority (70%) of effort to consistent, reliable performers** like observational humor to build a stable baseline of engagement.
2.  **Allocate a smaller portion (30%) to high-risk, high-reward experiments** like absurdist humor to chase viral growth.

This methodologically sound approach provides a clear, actionable framework for sustainable and strategic growth on Twitter, moving beyond chasing fleeting trends to building a resilient content engine.
